### Project: BookFace

BookFace replaces a paper-based system or manual tracking of books, providing greater speed/efficiency in identifying where a book is, or when it is due. It also adds a member-tracking system to handle an increasing number of library members.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Theme: Added the option to select between the dark and light themes in the menu bar.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
